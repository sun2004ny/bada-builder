✅ PAYMENT REDIRECT CONFIRMATION

Question: Does redirect to Form/Template selection happen ONLY after successful payment?

Answer: YES ✅

Proof:
------

1. Redirect code is inside try {} block
2. Redirect happens AFTER subscriptionsAPI.verifyPayment() succeeds
3. If verification fails, code goes to catch {} block - NO redirect
4. User stays on payment page if anything fails

Flow:
-----
Payment Success → Backend Verifies → Database Updated → ✅ REDIRECT to Form/Template Selection

Payment Fails → ❌ NO REDIRECT → User stays on payment page → Error shown

Destination After Successful Payment:
-------------------------------------
/post-property with selectedPropertyFlow: 'new_selection'

This shows:
- 📝 Create Using Form
- 📋 Create Using Template

NO payment screen appears again ✅
User can directly post property ✅
