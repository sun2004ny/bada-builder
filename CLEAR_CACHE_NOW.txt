🚨 IMPORTANT: CLEAR YOUR BROWSER CACHE! 🚨

The error you're seeing is because your browser is using OLD cached JavaScript files.

The code is ALREADY FIXED, but your browser hasn't loaded the new version yet.

HOW TO FIX:
===========

Windows/Linux: Press Ctrl + Shift + R
Mac: Press Cmd + Shift + R

OR

1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

AFTER CLEARING CACHE:
====================
✅ No "addDoc is not defined" error
✅ Payment will work perfectly
✅ Properties will post successfully

The code is correct - you just need to clear the cache!
